# Knowledge Files

[Back to docs index](README.md) | [Back to project README](../README.md)

Knowledge files are the local source material used for mention-based questions.

Related pages: [Setup Guide](setup.md), [Configuration Guide](configuration.md), [Operations Guide](operations.md), [Architecture](architecture.md).

## Supported Types

- `.txt` files are read as UTF-8 text.
- `.pdf` files are parsed with `pdf-parse`.
- `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.heic`, and `.heif` files are converted to text by `imageText.provider`.

## Folder Layout

Put files under `data/`. Subfolders are scanned recursively.

```text
data/
  admissions-2569.txt
  handbooks/
    student-handbook.pdf
  faq/
    general-faq.txt
  posters/
    event.jpg
```

Rules:

- Keep filenames descriptive because filenames are shown as `Sources` in Discord.
- Do not put API keys, passwords, or private credentials in knowledge files.
- Avoid adding private image data unless your configured image text provider is acceptable for that data.
- Large PDFs create more chunks and can dominate retrieval results.
- Image files must be under `imageText.maxBytes`.

## Indexing Behavior

The bot indexes `data/` on startup.

During indexing, it:

- Lists files recursively.
- Filters unsupported extensions.
- Extracts text from `.txt`, `.pdf`, and supported image files.
- Splits documents using `retrieval.chunkSize` and `retrieval.chunkOverlap`.
- Adds metadata including source path, chunk index, and `qdrant.indexId`.
- Deletes old Qdrant points for the current `qdrant.indexId`.
- Upserts the new chunks into Qdrant.

Use `/refresh` after adding, editing, or deleting files outside Discord while the bot is running.

## Uploads From Discord

`/upload` accepts `.txt`, `.pdf`, and supported image attachments.

Behavior:

- The command is restricted by `DISCORD_ADMIN_USER_IDS` and `DISCORD_MODERATOR_ROLE_IDS`.
- The optional folder field autocompletes existing folders.
- A typed folder path can create a new folder under `data/`.
- Folder paths are normalized and must stay inside `data/`.
- After saving the file, the bot refreshes the vector index automatically.

## Viewing Files From Discord

`/view` sends an existing knowledge file from `data/` back into Discord.

Mention-based answers can also include a source-file button when `commands.ask.topSourceButton` is `true`. Anyone can click that button, open a pick list, and choose a related source file. The selected file is sent only to the clicking user as an ephemeral Discord reply. Files too large for Discord are uploaded to tmpfiles and returned as an ephemeral link.

Behavior:

- The file option autocompletes matching paths under `data/`.
- When `commands.view.allowEveryone` is `true`, every user can see suggestions and use `/view`.
- When `commands.view.allowEveryone` is `false`, `/view` requires `DISCORD_ADMIN_USER_IDS` or `DISCORD_MODERATOR_ROLE_IDS`.
- The command validates the selected path so it stays inside `data/`.
- Files within Discord's attachment limit are sent directly.
- Larger files are uploaded to tmpfiles and returned as a link.

## Image Text Cache

Images are converted to text during indexing and cached under `.cache/image-text/` by default.

Cache identity includes:

- Image file hash.
- Provider ID.
- Model name.
- Prompt version.

Unchanged images reuse cached extracted text. Change `imageText.promptVersion` to force re-extraction.

## Docker Data Behavior

Docker Compose mounts:

- `./data` to `/app/data`.
- `./.cache` to `/app/.cache`.
- `./config.yaml` to `/app/config.yaml`.
- `.env` values into the bot service, including `DISCORD_*` settings.

Because of those mounts, `/upload` writes to the host `data/` directory and image text cache survives container rebuilds.
